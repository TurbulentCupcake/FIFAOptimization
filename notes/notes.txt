4. Our objective is to maximize team rating by maximizing attributes based on optimal team formation
5. Once we have this, we must simulateously maximize for best possible team while minimizing costs
6. We must also optimize the opposing team so that theoretically, both players are playing their best move.
7. We must find a way to probabilistically determine a winner based on  
    a. Player ratings
    b. Player fitness
    c.Player morale (overall during a season and probably during game too, i.e. if a team gets an early goal)
    d. Team rating
    e. The determination of players e.g. cup matches > league matches
    f. The weather during the match
    g. Home vs away is likely to be used as a variable also.
